# Stoicism

## History

- Founded by Zeno of Citium.
- (Greece & Rome) Rise in democracy increased importance of being able to persuade others.  Parents would send kids to schools of philosophy to develop skills.
- Stoics fell somewhere between the Cyrenaics and the Cynics: enjoy good things but don’t cling to them.
- Zeno (founder) —> Cleanthes (maintainer) —> Chrysippus (builder) —> Panaetius (exporter)

## Core Principles

- Having SOME philosophy is inherently better than having NO philosophy.  It’s important to reflect and reshape ones philosophy to fit ones lifestyle, values, and missions in life.
- The Stoics favor a lifestyle that although simple, allows creature comforts.  It’s okay to enjoy good things, but never become dependent on them.
- Logic —> Physics —> Ethics was the general progression for Stoic students.
- “Ethics” in this era was about how to live a good life. A life of virtue.  Not moral wisdom and good vs. bad.
- “Stoic tranquility was a psychological state, marked by the absence of negative emotions, such as grief, anger, and anxiety, and the presence of positive emotions such as joy"
- Negative Visualization - contemplating the bad things that can happen.
- Marcus thinks: ‘the key to having a good life is to value things that are genuinely valuable and be indifferent to things that lack value'
- On satisfaction: ‘the best way to gain satisfaction is not by working to satisfy whatever desires we find within us but by learning to be satisfied with our life as it is—by learning to be happy with whatever we’ve got.'
    - Although Stoics would have been satisfied with next to nothing, they nevertheless strove for something.  I think that’s an important distinction to point out and think about.  Being a Stoic does NOT mean stop trying to achieve anything.
- Avoid a dependency on fancy goods by ‘practicing poverty’.  Go on X day vacations from expensive foods, wines, devices, etc.

## Excerpts

- “…the goal of the Stoics was not to banish emotion from life but to banish negative emotion. (7,gttg)"
- “The enlightened hedonists grand goal in living is to maximize the pleasure he experiences in the course of a lifetime. (11, gttg)"
- “..pay attention to your enemies, for they are the first to discover your mistakes. (30, gttg)"
- “Misfortune weighs most heavily, he says, on those who ‘expect nothing but good fortune’. (65, gttg)"
- “…all we have is ‘on loan’ from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission. (68, gttg)"
- “..we should periodically cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could easily have avoided.  We might accomplish this by underdressing for cold weather or going shoeless. (111, gttg)"
    - “discomfort can be thought of as a kind of vaccine: By exposing ourselves to a small amount of a weakened virus now, we create in ourselves an immunity that will protect us from a debilitating illness in the future. (112, gttg)”  —> the hard part of this is we will never know what the illness would have been if we sufficiently practice this philosophy.  Perhaps this is a good thing, but it makes the logical aspect of humans brains hard to justify the continued actions required to reap the rewards.

**The “Good” Life...**  
a virtuous (or excellent) hammer is one that performs well the function for which it was designed—namely, to drive nails—a virtuous individual is one who performs well the function for which humans were designed.  To be virtuous, then, is to live as we were designed to life; it is to live, as Zeno put it, in accordance with nature.  The Stoics would add that if we do this, we will have a good life.

**Field analogy...**  
Stoic philosophy is like a fertile field, with “Logic being the encircling fence, Ethics the crop, Physics the soil”.  Ethics === central.  Why worry about the soil and why build a fence unless a crop will result?

**The sage (master)...**   
is just a target to aim at.  There is no expectation that everyone can become a sage.  Rather, it is the target to strive for even if failure is self evident.

**Hedonic adaptation...**  
initial delight and pleasure we experience when buying something that quickly dissipates and upsets us.  Example: ‘Likewise, we experience hedonic adaptation in our career.  We might once have dreamed of getting a certain job.  We might consequently have worked hard in college and maybe graduate school as well to get on the proper career path, and on that path, we might have spent years making slow but steady progress toward our career goal.  On finally landing the job of our dreams, we will be delighted, but before long we are likely to grow dissatisfied.  We will grumble about our pay, our coworkers, and the failure of our boss to recognize our talents.” (66, gttg)

**Projective visualization...** 
is when something bad happens you consider the possibility that it happened to someone else.  How would you consul the individual?  Put the event into proper perspective; it’s usually not that big of a deal.

**The Trichotomy of Control...** 

- Things over which we have complete control (such as the goals we set for ourselves)
- Things over which we have no control at all (sun rising tomorrow morning)
- Things over which we have some but not complete control (such as whether we win while playing tennis)
