**Stock Option**: a contract that gives the owner the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset (the underlying stock) at a fixed
price (the strike price) for a specific period of time (until expiration)... In
laymans terms:

> The right to buy or sell a specific stock at a certain price for a limited
> period of time

They are called derivatives because their values are derived from, or based on,
another financial institution (the stock).

**1 option contract** === **100 shares of stock**

> Most option traders don't actually buy the underlying stock, they resell the
> option at a higher premium thus avoiding the hassle of buying the stock.

**Mini Options**: certain high priced stocks allow you to actually buy contracts
of 10 shares.  These are way less common though and shouldn't be considered for
now.

> **Tip** the more time left on an option, the more valuable it is.  More
> opportunity it has to increase in value.

## Types

Four words to remember: `call`, `put`, `buy`, `sell`. That's it. All fancier
words are derived on these four basic concepts.  You can buy/sell calls and
puts.

**Call**: you're "going long".  Reserve the right to **buy** a stock in the
future at whatever the price of the call was.  Allows you to participate in the
success of a company without having to pay for all the shares!

**Put**: taking a short position in the stock.  You think the value of the stock
will fall.

## Call

When buying a call, the higher the strike price is from the current value the
stock is trading at the cheaper the option will be.  It makes sense because the
riskier it is that the stock will actually go up to that value.  So if stock X
is trading at $10, options to buy at $10 will be expensive, $12 will be cheaper,
and $15 will be the cheapest because it's least likely the stock will raise
value to be $15.

## Put

## Vocab

**Strike Price**: price you pay to get the shares.
**Premium**: If buyer, the price you pay to have the right to buy. If seller, it's the money you receive for giving the right.

* start with just buying 1 contract (100 shares)
