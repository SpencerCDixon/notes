**Stock Option**: a contract that gives the owner the right, but not the
obligation, to buy or sell a particular asset (the underlying stock) at a fixed
price (the strike price) for a specific period of time (until expiration)... In
laymans terms:

> The right to buy or sell a specific stock at a certain price for a limited
> period of time

They are called derivatives because their values are derived from, or based on,
another financial institution (the stock).

**1 option contract** === **100 shares of stock**

> Most option traders don't actually buy the underlying stock, they resell the
> option at a higher premium thus avoiding the hassle of buying the stock.

**Mini Options**: certain high priced stocks allow you to actually buy contracts
of 10 shares.  These are way less common though and shouldn't be considered for
now.

> **Tip** the more time left on an option, the more valuable it is.  More
> opportunity it has to increase in value.

## Types

Four words to remember: `call`, `put`, `buy`, `sell`. That's it. All fancier
words are derived on these four basic concepts.  You can buy/sell calls and
puts.

**Call**: you're "going long".  Reserve the right to **buy** a stock in the
future at whatever the price of the call was.  Allows you to participate in the
success of a company without having to pay for all the shares!

**Put**: taking a short position in the stock.  You think the value of the stock
will fall.

## Call

When buying a call, the higher the strike price is from the current value the
stock is trading at the cheaper the option will be.  It makes sense because the
riskier it is that the stock will actually go up to that value.  So if stock X
is trading at $10, options to buy at $10 will be expensive, $12 will be cheaper,
and $15 will be the cheapest because it's least likely the stock will raise
value to be $15.

**Covered Calls**:  
_Selling_ or _writing covered calls_ mean the same thing.  A covered calls just
means you're selling a call on _stock that you already own_.

Two reasons you'd sell a covered call:

1.  Generate short term cash flow (the premium for selling the call)
2.  As a general method of selling stock that you own.
3.  Extra: some 401k/tax deferred accounts let you sell covered calls.  Great way to generate income in these accounts!

So, if you're already thinking of selling some shares of stock X, you mine as
well do it as a covered call to get a few extra bucks on the premium.  

> Useful analogy --> it's like buying a house and renting it to someone.

**At-the-money**: when the option strike price is within a few pennies of what the stock is currently trading for. In options chain graphs this is the line that changes the colors.
**Out-of-the-money**: when the strike price of the call option is higher than the price of the underlying stock.
**In-the-money**: when the strike price of the call option is lower than the price of the underlying stock.

If I sell a covered call and by the expiration date the option is 'in the
money', meaning the strike price is less than what the stock is trading for.  I
will get _assigned_ an exercise notice: meaning that the person who owns the
option is going to buy my shares to make their profit.  The buyer only makes a
profit if the difference between strike/actual is greater than the premium they
paid me to have the _right_ to buy my shares.

**If you are going to sell a covered call, you should be prepared to sell your
stock at the strike price of the covered call!**

The main attributes that affect selling a covered call are:
* Market environment
* Underlying stock
* Strike price
* Premium
* Expiration date
* Interest rates
* Dividends

### Trading Plan (covered calls)

After selling a covered call the work doesn't end -- it just begins.  You need
to look after the option (and even develop a trading plan) to make sure things
are going how you want them to. 

**stock price goes above strike** - it's okay, you miss out on some profit (diff
from strike of option and actual value) but you still make money (the premium
and profit from price you purchased stock at).  

**stoke stays same price** - this is the ideal situation, you just got paid a
premium for renting a right.

**stoke price goes down** - action _may_ be required.  If you think the stock
will recover then you can do nothing and you just got paid a premium to offset
any temporary loss.  If it goes below the breakeven price (stock price -
premium) then you might want to consider buying back the option and selling the
stock to avoid any further damages.

### Buying Calls

When buying my first calls I should focus on in the money options.  
These calls-have more _instrinsic_ value and require less rallying of the underlying stock-to go up in order for me to 
get my money back.  Buying calls out of the money is-a lot cheaper but
means that I have to be very confident the stock is going to-rise a l
ot for some reason.-


## Put

## Vocab

**Strike Price**: price you pay to get the shares.
**Premium**: If buyer, the price you pay to have the right to buy. If seller, it's the money you receive for giving the right.
**At-the-money**: when the option strike price is within a few pennies of what the stock is currently trading for. In options chain graphs this is the line that changes the colors.
**Out-of-the-money**: when the strike price of the call option is higher than the price of the underlying stock.
**In-the-money**: when the strike price of the call option is lower than the price of the underlying stock.

## Initial Learning Strategies

_Some notes on how to best get started_

* start with just buying 1 contract (100 shares)
* start with buying covered calls a little 'out of the money' until I gain more experience to know when to swing farther left/right
