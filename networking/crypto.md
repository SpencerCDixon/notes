# Cryptography

"One" time pad - like a caesar cipher except instead of shifting letters the
same amount for each character you have a variable number of shifts.  One
advantage is similar characters ('a's for example) will appear differently in a
one time pad than they will in a caesar cipher.


### Public Key Cryptography

**Why?** - you have two people who want to communicate over the internet which
is intrinsically insecure.  You need a way to make it secure and PKC is the
solution.
