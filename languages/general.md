**Context-free Grammer**: the set of rules that describe all possible strings
in a given formal language.

**Extended Backus-Naur Form**: a meta-syntax notation which can be used to
express CFG programming languages.  Essentially, it's a language that can be
used to define other languages.  Useful when you want to define the 'rules' of a
language you're building in an easy to understand way.

**Compiler**: takes source code and converts it all into machine code.  Compiled
languages are generally harder to debug. Examples include: C, C++, Go, etc.

**Interpreter**: takes source and translates it one statement at a time. Takes
less time to analyze the source but slower to execution time. Examples include:
Ruby, Python, etc.
